\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}

\subsection{Game Functionality Testing}

\paragraph{}
A Robot (automated) unit testing class was implemented and used to test the mechanics of the game.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{GFT1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the main menu page
					
Input: Cursor clicked on Start Game button
					
Expected Output: New game is started and window is changed to reflect a new game state

Output: New game was started and window was changed to reflect a new game state

Result: PASS


\item{GFT11\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Within game state
					
Input: Escape button pressed
					
Expected Output: Application must pause and ask user if they want to quit

Output: Game was paused and user was asked to quit or continue

Result: PASS

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Player Movement/Collision Testing}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{GFT2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Within the game state
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Player moves in the respective direction (if path is clear)

Output: Player moved in the respective direction when path was clear
					
Result: PASS

\item{GFT3\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player comes in contact with wall
					
Input: No input
					
Expected Output: Player stops moving when coming in contact with the wall

Output: Player's x and y coordinates were not changed when in contact with the wall

Result: PASS

\item{GFT4\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player comes in contact with enemy
					
Input: No input
					
Expected Output: If player has more than 1 life, decrement lives. If player has one life, end game.

Output: Player's life was decremented by 1 when player had more than one life. The game was ended if player was on their last life.

Result: PASS

\item{GFT6\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player comes in contact with dots
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Dot disappears after collection

Output: Dot disappeared afer player colletcted it

Result: PASS

\item{GFT7\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects the big dot
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Big dot disappears after collection

Output: Big dot disappeared after player collected it

Result: PASS

\item{GFT8\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects the big dot
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Player is able to collide with enemies

Output: Player does not lose any lives when colliding with enemy

Result: PASS

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Enemy Movement/Collision Testing}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{GFT5\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Within the game state
					
Input: No input
					
Expected Output: Enemies move on a valid path

Output: Enemy does not go through barriers

Result: PASS

\item{GFT9\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects the big dot
					
Input: No input
					
Expected Output: Enemies change colour

Output: Enemies changed colours

Result: PASS

\item{GFT14\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collides with enemy after collection of big dot
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Enemy is removed from game and respawned back to their original cell

Output: Enemy is respawned back to the center of the game

Result: PASS

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Scoring Testing}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{GFT10\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects all dots
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: Game over screen is activated

Output: Player's score is displayed along with the Game Over screen

Result: PASS

\item{GFT12\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects dot
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: The points are increased

Output: Player's score is increased by 100

Result: PASS

\item{GFT13\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Player collects big dot
					
Input: Arrow keys
					
Expected Output: The points are increased at twice the rate

Output: Player's score is increased by 200

Result: PASS

\end{enumerate}
