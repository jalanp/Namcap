This document is the test plan for the Pacman redevelopment project, Namcap. The test plan outlines the testin methodologies and techniques to be used when testing the functionalities and characteristics of the system and its component parts.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
\paragraph{}
The purpose of testing is to ensure that the developed implementation functions correctly and to address any areas where the system is vulnerable. Through the formal specification of the testing methods and verification techniques, testing the implementation becomes mroe reliable.

\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{}
As Namcap is a redevelopment of a classic arcade game, the test plan will aim to formalize the various functionality testing techniques as well as the usability tests utilized in order to ensure that the implementation meets the given requirement. This document will explicitly detail the different methods and testing tools to be utilized for this project.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
\paragraph{}
This document will describe the testing methodologies to be utilized to verify Namcap as an implementation and development. The test plan will outline all testing tools, schedules, automated and manual tests, tests to address the requirements for the application, unit tests, and any additional testing performed on the PoC and existing implementation.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
\paragraph{}
Namcap is a redevelopment of the classic 2D arcade game Pacman. The gameplay involves the player sprite moving through a 2D level attempting to acquire (collide with) as many dots as possible to increase the score. Enemy sprites (ghosts in the original) will move throughout the level and upon collision with the player will cause the player to lose a life and/or end the game. The player can however consume (collide with) a power up to send the enemies back to the center of the level (when collision occurs). The implementation covers these aspects of the core gameplay (scoring, collision, movement, and enemy mechanics).

\subsection{Test Team}
\paragraph{}
The test team for Namcap is comprised of Prajvin Jalan, Vatsal Shukla, and Baltej Toor.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\paragraph{}
For the purposes of automated testing, the test team will use both JUnit and the built-in Robot class library. JUnit is a unit testing framework that will run automated tests for most logical components and any GUI components where applicable. The Robot class library will be used to automate testing that simulates user input. Based on the simulated user input, logical and GUI components will be tested to ensure that the appropriate collision and scoring responses occur.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\paragraph{}
The automated unit testing tool JUnit and the Robot class library are the only testing tools that the team will use to verify the implementation.

\subsection{Testing Schedule}

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

Before additional features can be added to the game, a basic proof of concept will be carried out to show that the project is feasible. 

\subsection{Significant Risk}

In order for the game to run, it must be succesfully compiled. Therefore, the game is intended to work on all operating systems as long as they have the latest version on Java installed. However, this can be a risk if the game is unable to run on some operating systems.

\subsection{Demonstration Plan}

For the proof of concept, a working prototype of the game will be produced that will run by opening a JAR file on any operating system with Java installed. The prototype will consist of the game which implements a player and enemy movement, collision detection, points system, and boundary detection.

	The game will consist of a basic Pacman map layout in which a player character and enemy character will exist. The player and enemy character will start at a specific point on the map. Neither the player nor the enemy can pass through the walls on the map. The player will be able to collect the dots to increment the game points. Upon collision with the enemy, the game will end and output the final score.

	The player character will be represented by a pacman .png file that will be located in the assets package within the project. The enemy character will be represented by a ghost .png file that will also be located in the assets package. The player will be controlled by the user by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

	The enemy will have a simple AI programmed for the proof of concept. The AI will allow the enemy to move in the direction they are currently moving unless it hits a barrier. Then, the AI will randomly generate a direction for the enemy to move in. The enemy will move in the new generated direction if the path is clear, else, another direction is generated.
		
\paragraph{Proof of Concept Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PoCT1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application unopened
					
Input: Double-click the JAR file to run the game
					
Output: All PoC requirements met
					
How test will be performed: The test will be performed manually by either the TA or the professor.
					
\end{enumerate}
