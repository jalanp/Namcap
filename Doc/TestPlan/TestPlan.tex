This document is the test plan for the Pacman redevelopment project, Namcap. The test plan outlines the testin methodologies and techniques to be used when testing the functionalities and characteristics of the system and its component parts.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
\paragraph{}
The purpose of testing is to ensure that the developed implementation functions correctly and to address any areas where the system is vulnerable. Through the formal specification of the testing methods and verification techniques, testing the implementation becomes mroe reliable.

\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{}
As Namcap is a redevelopment of a classic arcade game, the test plan will aim to formalize the various functionality testing techniques as well as the usability tests utilized in order to ensure that the implementation meets the given requirement. This document will explicitly detail the different methods and testing tools to be utilized for this project.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
\paragraph{}
This document will describe the testing methodologies to be utilized to verify Namcap as an implementation and development. The test plan will outline all testing tools, schedules, automated and manual tests, tests to address the requirements for the application, unit tests, and any additional testing performed on the PoC and existing implementation.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
\paragraph{}
Namcap is a redevelopment of the classic 2D arcade game Pacman. The gameplay involves the player sprite moving through a 2D level attempting to acquire (collide with) as many dots as possible to increase the score. Enemy sprites (ghosts in the original) will move throughout the level and upon collision with the player will cause the player to lose a life and/or end the game. The player can however consume (collide with) a power up to send the enemies back to the center of the level (when collision occurs). The implementation covers these aspects of the core gameplay (scoring, collision, movement, and enemy mechanics).

\subsection{Test Team}
\paragraph{}
The test team for Namcap is comprised of Prajvin Jalan, Vatsal Shukla, and Baltej Toor.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\paragraph{}
For the purposes of automated testing, the test team will use both JUnit and the built-in Robot class library. JUnit is a unit testing framework that will run automated tests for most logical components and any GUI components where applicable. The Robot class library will be used to automate testing that simulates user input. Based on the simulated user input, logical and GUI components will be tested to ensure that the appropriate collision and scoring responses occur.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\paragraph{}
The automated unit testing tool JUnit and the Robot class library are the only testing tools that the team will use to verify the implementation.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: 
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State:

Output: 
					
How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Non-functional Requirements}

\paragraph{}
This section of System Testing will consist of manual tests since it would be infeasible to implement automated tests for a majority of the subsections of Non-functional Requirements. Manual tests will be performed by users, therefore many of the tests will correspond with the Usability Survey so testers can ensure that these requirements are met.

\subsubsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
		
\paragraph{Application Layout}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{AL1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the instructions page
					
Input: No user input
					
Output: Namcap instructions page
					
How test will be performed: User will look at the Namcap instructions page and ensure that the layout and color scheme of the display is similar (but not identical) to that of the original arcade Pacman
					
\item{AL2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the game board with game entities
					
Input: No user input
					
Output: Namcap game board with game entities
					
How test will be performed: User will look at the Namcap game board with its game entities and ensure that the layout and color scheme of the display is similar (but not identical) to that of the original arcade Pacman

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\paragraph{Understandable Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UO1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the instructions page
					
Input: No user input
					
Output: Namcap instructions page in English
					
How test will be performed: User will look at the Namcap instructions page and ensure that the instructions are in English
					
\item{UO2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the instructions page
					
Input: No user input
					
Output: Namcap instructions page clearly defining objectives
					
How test will be performed: User will look at the Namcap instructions page and ensure that the objective of the game is clear before playing the game

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Understandable Gameplay}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UG1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application is displaying the game board with game entities
					
Input: Custom user input for gameplay
					
Output: Game display updates accounting for movement, collision, scoring, and enemy mechanics
					
How test will be performed: User will play Namcap (one playthrough - 3 lives) and be able to successfully maneuver the Player through dots and enemies, reinforcing their understanding of the game's controls and objectives
